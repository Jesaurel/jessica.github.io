  "description": "A modern calculator app I built in just one day using Python and Tkinter. What started as a fun mini-challenge turned into a clean, functional tool with support for basic operations, trigonometric functions, and more. I wanted to test how much I could build in a short time, focusing on usability and simple design. Tkinter was perfect for fast development, and I used the project to sharpen both my UI and logic-building skills.",
